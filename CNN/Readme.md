# Lifelong Object Recognition and Grasp Synthesis using Dual Memory Recurrent Self-Organization Networks

## Autoencoder 

The code in utils and inference directories are the adaptation of kumra's [robotic-grasping](https://github.com/skumra/robotic-grasping) open soruce code for generative residual convolutional neural network (GR-ConvNet), a pre-trained model in our autoencoder.
